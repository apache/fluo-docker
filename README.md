# Apache Fluo Docker Image

## Obtain the Docker image

To obtain the docker image created by this project, you can either pull it from DockerHub at
`mikewalch/fluo` or build it yourself. To pull the image from DockerHub, run the command below:

    sudo docker pull mikewalch/fluo

While it is easier to pull from DockerHub, the image will default to the software versions below:

| Software    | Version        |
|-------------|----------------|
| [Fluo]      | 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT |
| [Accumulo]  | 1.8.1          |
| [Hadoop]    | 2.7.3          |
| [Zookeeper] | 3.4.9          |

If these versions do not match what is running on your cluster, you should consider building
your own image with matching versions. However, Fluo must be 1.2+. Below are instructions for
building an image:

1. Clone the Fluo docker repo

        git clone git@github.com:apache/fluo-docker.git

2. Until Fluo 1.2 is released, build a Fluo tarball distribution and copy it to the root
   directory of the repo.

        git clone git@github.com:apache/fluo.git
        cd fluo/
        mvn clean package
        cp modules/distribution/target/fluo-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz /path/to/fluo-docker/

3. Build the default Fluo docker image using the command below.

        cd /path/to/fluo-docker
        docker build -t fluo .

   Or build the Fluo docker image with specific versions of Hadoop, Zookeeper, etc using the command below:

        docker build --build-arg ZOOKEEPER_VERSION=3.4.8 --build-arg ACCUMULO_VERSION=1.7.3 --build-arg HADOOP_VERSION=2.7.0 -t fluo .

## Image basics

The entrypoint for the Fluo docker image is the `fluo` script. While the primary use
case for this image is to start an oracle or worker, you can run other commands in the
`fluo` script to test out the image:

```bash
# No arguments prints Fluo command usage
docker run mikewalch/fluo
# Print Fluo version
docker run mikewalch/fluo version
# Print Fluo classpath
docker run mikewalch/fluo classpath
```

# Run Fluo Applications using Docker

Before starting a Fluo oracle and worker using the Fluo Docker image, [initialize your Fluo application][application]. 
Next, choose a method below to run the oracle and worker(s) of your Fluo application. In the examples below, the Fluo
application is named `myapp` and was initialized using a Zookeeper node on `zkhost`.

## Docker engine

Use the `docker` command to start local docker containers.

1. Start a Fluo oracle

        docker run -d --network="host" mikewalch/fluo oracle -a myapp -o fluo.connection.zookeepers=zkhost/fluo

2. Start Fluo worker(s). Execute this command multiple times to start multiple workers.

        docker run -d --network="host" mikewalch/fluo worker -a myapp -o fluo.connection.zookeepers=zkhost/fluo

## Marathon

Using the [Marathon] UI, you can create applications using JSON configuration.

The JSON below can be used to start a Fluo oracle.

```json
{
  "id": "myapp-fluo-oracle",
  "cmd": "fluo oracle -a myapp -o fluo.connection.zookeepers=zkhost/fluo",
  "cpus": 1,
  "mem": 256,
  "disk": 0,
  "instances": 1,
  "container": {
    "docker": {
      "image": "mikewalch/fluo",
      "network": "HOST"
    },
    "type": "DOCKER"
  }
}
```

The JSON below can be used to start Fluo worker(s). Modify instances to start multiple workers.

```json
{
  "id": "myapp-fluo-worker",
  "cmd": "fluo worker -a myapp -o fluo.connection.zookeepers=zkhost/fluo",
  "cpus": 1,
  "mem": 512,
  "disk": 0,
  "instances": 1,
  "container": {
    "docker": {
      "image": "mikewalch/fluo",
      "network": "HOST"
    },
    "type": "DOCKER"
  }
}
