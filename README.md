# Apache Fluo Docker Image

**This is currently a work in progress that depends on unreleased features of Fluo and will not be ready for use until after Fluo 1.2.0 is released.**  Sometime after Fluo 1.2.0 is released this project will make its first release. Eventually, this will project will create a `apache/fluo` image at DockerHub. Until then, you will need to build your own image.

This project creates the official [Apache Fluo][Fluo] docker image.
